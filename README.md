# Lire

Lire is a simple tool for reading French text. It displays pre-written passages and lets you click any word to see its definition and sample sentences for how it can be used.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies (which includes the `remark-breaks` plugin) and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If the build fails with `Module not found: Can't resolve 'remark-breaks'`, install the
plugin manually:

```bash
npm install remark-breaks
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
